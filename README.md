## Repository Overview

This repository hosts a single Jupyter notebook used for the comprehensive analysis of TERRA repeat motifs in RNA-seq data across multiple contexts:
- SpaceX Inspiration4 astronaut blood samples
- NASA Twins Study data
- High-altitude climbing samples (Mt. Everest)
- Simulated microgravity samples
- Ionizing radiation cell culture studies

Key features of the analysis include:
- Telomeric motif detection (`UUAGGG`, `UUAGG`, etc.) via k-mer enrichment
- Mannâ€“Whitney U test comparisons across experimental groups
- Pearson correlation analysis of motif co-occurrence
- Visualization of longitudinal expression patterns
